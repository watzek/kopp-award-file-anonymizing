# kopp-award-file-anonymizing
Google Apps Script for updating file names to standardize and anonymize them.

As part of the Kopp Award submission process, students must submit three pdfs. This script does the following:

- Eliminates the need for students to follow a specific file naming convention.
- Renames files to the convention idnumber_type.pdf (e.g. 1234567_essay.pdf)

### Setup
- Once form is set up, enable form collection to populat a spreadsheet.
- In the spreadsheet, select Extentions->Apps Script
- In the code.gs space, replace the default with the contents of [googleAppsScript.js](googleAppsScript.js)
